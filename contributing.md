If there are new changes in the upstream and a merge conflict occurs in your pull request, you may resolve merge conflicts on GitHub or through the command line. To resolve merge conflicts on GitHub, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github.
The process to resolve merge conflicts through the command line is as follows:
```
$ git checkout master

$ git pull upstream master
Fetch the latest changes from upstream's master and merge them with your
repository's master branch

$ git checkout BRANCHNAME

$ git merge master
Merge the changes from master onto your branch
```
If there are merge conflicts, an error containing the list of affected files will be thrown. The message in the affected files will be as follows:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Change in your branch
=======
Change in master
>>>>>>> master
```
Resolve the conflict by manually editing the file to keep the changes you want then:
```
$ git add affectedfile

$ git commit -m 'Resolve merge conflict'
Commit the merge

$ git push origin BRANCHNAME
Learn more: https://help.github.com/en/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line
```
For GET requests modules _only_, python and javascript sample code can be auto-generated by following the instructions below:
```
$ cd mediawiki-api-demos
Add module information to `modules.json`
$ python autogenerator.py
Make desired changes to the newly generated file(s)
